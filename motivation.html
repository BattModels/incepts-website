  Vehicle electrification has been an ongoing process for the past several years. Electric vehicles (EVs) have been shown with market analysis to nearly be at the point where consumers will prefer to buy an EV over a gas-powered vehicle. The <a href=https://www.castrol.com/content/dam/castrol/master-site/en/global/home/technology-and-innovation/electric-vehicle-adoption/accelerating_the_evolution_study.pdf>three pillars identified</a> as needing to be met for widespread EV adoption are 1. MSRP at or below $36,000; 2. EV range of at least 291 miles; and 3. Widespread fast charging stations. While the EVs in the market already have, or will shortly, <a href=https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2020>achieve pillars 1 and 2</a>; the charging infrastructure required by pillar 3 is extremely limited. A <a href=https://theicct.org/publications/charging-gap-US>2019 study</a> found that out of the 100 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas, 88 had less than half of the total charging infrastructure that they are expected to need by 2025. While charging at home is possible, a lack of in-home and publicly accessible fast chargers has led to nearly <a href=https://www.businessinsider.in/1-in-5-electric-vehicle-owners-in-California-switched-back-to-gas-because-charging-their-cars-is-a-hassle-new-research-shows/articleshow/82332806.cms>1 in 5 EV owners in California choosing to revert back to a gas-powered vehicle</a>.

  Fast chargers cost approximately $250,000, thus adopting a widespread charging infrastructure requires an optimal placement of the chargers to minimize the economic cost while ensuring that the demand is satisfied.
